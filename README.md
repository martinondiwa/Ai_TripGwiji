Set Up
Setup Project: Initialize a React app using create-react-app and install necessary packages like Firebase and Axios.

Firebase Setup: Create a Firebase project, set up Firestore for data storage, and configure Firebase Authentication for user login (e.g., Google login).

Google Places API Integration: Enable the Google Places API, get the API key, and integrate Google Places Autocomplete for destination selection in your React app.

State Management: Use React hooks (like useState and useEffect) to manage user input for trip preferences (destination, budget, duration, etc.).

User Authentication: Implement Google login with Firebase Authentication and ensure users' information is stored in Firebase Firestore upon sign-in.

AI Trip Suggestion Logic: Use Gemini AI (or other AI services) to fetch trip recommendations based on user input (destination, budget, companions).

Store Trip Data: Save the generated trip details in Firebase Firestore, associating them with the authenticated user's profile.

Real-Time Updates: Use Firebase real-time updates to display trip results dynamically as they are generated.

UI/UX Design: Implement a clean UI using CSS/React libraries (like Material-UI) for smooth user interactions, including dynamic transitions and feedback on trip creation.

Testing and Deployment: Test the app thoroughly for edge cases and deploy it using Firebase Hosting or other platforms like Netlify.
